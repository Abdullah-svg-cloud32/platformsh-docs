Welcome to Upsun!

This guide is meant to take you from knowing next to nothing about Upsun, what it does, and how to work with it, all the way to understanding all of its core concepts to deploy your own application on the platform.

This guide is meant to help you download a few tools and set up your very first custom application on Upsun.
It will review some of the core concepts of Upsun as you go along, but most of those are meant to have been covered in the demo application.
